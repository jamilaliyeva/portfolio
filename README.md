### About me
I'm Jamila Rustamli, a Project Manager  with a secondary background in QA Manual, which allows me to have a full understanding of software development and quality assurance. I have 6 months of experience in web application testing and 3 months in mobile application testing, where I've been specializing in writing clear and effective test cases, conducting exploratory, regression, and smoke testing, and reporting defects in Jira. I also use Excel for tracking and Postman for basic API testing.

In addition to my QA work, I have hands-on experience in project management, such as creating and updating user stories, product backlog grooming, and cross-functional team coordination for timely delivery. My dual skill set allows me to visualize both the technical and organizational sides of software projects, resulting in better planning, more accurate requirements, and higher quality deliverables.

I hold Andersen Company's Quality Assurance for Beginners certification, which helped me master QA tools and methodologies. I am fluent in English, Azerbaijani, and Russian and thrive in multicultural, team-based environments where effective communication is key.

I strive to deliver stable, user-friendly software solutions and constantly grow as a QA and project manager.

### Experience
I began working as a **Project Manager**, where I directed software development projects and collaborated with cross-functional teams to produce quality digital products. Over time, I expanded my role to both **manual and automation QA testing**, allowing me to contribute more comprehensively to product quality and team productivity. I also carried out a **freelance project** in the **real estate industry**, performing a combination of project management tasks and hands-on testing. This blend of experience has given me a profound understanding of the technical as well as the strategic sides of product development.
